# What is a Boolean
- The defention of a Boolean is a denoting a system of algebraic notation used to represent logical propositions, especially in computing and electronics.
- A boolean expersions are either true or false
- What do we use to represent them (Hint think of how domain/range of graph is answered)

## Examples
- You have to be the age 16 or above to drive
- Each cart can only hold 4 people

# Logical Operators
- NOT, it displays the opposite of whatever the data is. Mainly used for true/false, and does not effect the variable.
![not]({{site.baseurl}}/images/not.png)
- AND, used to evaulte two conditions together and determine if both condintions are met
![and]({{site.baseurl}}/images/and.png)
- OR, when using or the function only looks to see if one of the conditions is met then will
![or]({{site.baseurl}}/images/or.png)

# Hacks
- Write a logical experision for this secarino, You win the game if you have at least 20 points and 3 live left or if you have 100 points and more than 0 lives left.
- Write a logical experision for example 1 NOT using >= or <=
