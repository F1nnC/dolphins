Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements | An else if inside of another else if | Can be used for a varying amount of “else if statements.” The first if statement can represent if two coditions are true. The first else if can represent if only one or the other is true. The last else if represents if neither of the conditions are true. | Can have three different conditions Examples .

Can be planned and writen out first | Flow chart is a possibility. Ask a question. If the statement is false end the flowchart with one result. If it is true then repeat the process once more. If this statement is false make a new result. Finally if the statement is true make a final result Take aways . | Learn how to determine the result of nested condtional statements | Nested conditional statements consist of conditional statements within conditional statements Hacks . | Create 3 differnt flow charts representing nested statements and transfer them into code. | Create a piece of code that displays four statements instead of three.
